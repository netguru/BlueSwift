Easy to use Bluetooth open source library brought to you by Netguru.<br/>
🤟 Probably the easiest way to interact with bluetooth peripherals 🤟

## 🤹🏻‍♂️ Features

- [x] Handles connection with remote peripherals.
- [x] Handles advertising an iPhone as Bluetooth LE peripheral.
- [x] Closure based read/write/notify requests.
- [x] Built in data conversion method with `Command` wrapper.

##  📲  Connection:

Below you can find an easy code sample to connect to the peripheral.<br/>
Really thats all that is needed 🍾🍾

```swift
let connection = BluetoothConnection.shared
let characteristic = try! Characteristic(uuid: "your_characteristic_uuid", shouldObserveNotification: true)
let service = try! Service(uuid: "your_service_uuid", characteristics: [characteristic])
let configuration = try! Configuration(services: [service], advertisement: "your_advertising_uuid")
let peripheral = Peripheral(configuration: configuration)
connection.connect(peripheral) { error in
	// do awesome stuff
}
```

## 📡 Advertisement:

Below you can find a code sample the setup the iPhone to advertise Bluetooth.<br/>
That's all it takes to advertise one service containing one characteristic.

```swift
let characteristic = try! Characteristic(uuid: "your_characteristic_uuid")
let service = try! Service(uuid: "your_service_uuid", characteristics: [characteristic])
let configuration = try! Configuration(services: [service], advertisement: "your_service_uuid")
let peripheral = Peripheral(configuration: configuration, advertisementData: [.localName("Test"), .servicesUUIDs("your_service_uuid")])
advertisement.advertise(peripheral: peripheral) { error in
	// oh no, something failed in that case          
}
```

## 📟 📲 Data transfer:

Of course data transfer is also possible, both for advertising and connection mode!
Below there are some basic examples, for more please see `More usage` section 👇🏻

## Connection mode:

```swift
let command = Command.utf8String("Hello world")
peripheral.write(command: command, characteristic: someCharacteristic, handler: { error in
	// written!
})
peripheral.read(characteristic, handler: { data, error in
	// read!
})
```

## Advertisement mode:

```swift
let command = Command.int8(3)
advertisement.update(command, characteristic: characteristic) { error in
	// data updated!
}
advertisement.writeRequestCallback = { characteristic, data in
	// written!
}
```

## ⚙️ More usage:

For more advanced usage check out documentation page at: https://netguru.github.io/BlueSwift/.<br/>
Also feel free to check example project bundled with this repository! 👩🏼‍🏫 👨🏼‍🏫
It's a complete app that allows connection and sending text messages between two iPhones.

## 🛠 Dependency management:

BlueSwift can be drag'n dropped to the project directory,<br/>
but what's more important it's supported by most common dependency management!

### ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/cocoapods-compatible-green.svg)

Just drop the line below to your Podfile:

`pod 'BlueSwift'`

(but probably you'd like to pin it to the nearest major release, so `pod 'BlueSwift' , '~> 1.1.4'`)

### ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/carthage-compatible-green.svg)

The same as with Cocoapods, insert the line below to your Cartfile:

`github 'netguru/BlueSwift'`

, or including version - `github 'netguru/BlueSwift' ~> 1.1.4`
